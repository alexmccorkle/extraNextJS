# extraNextJS Learning

Going to be doing a few different tutorials here and random learning/messing around. Figure one Repo is better than having a bunch of different ones.

### 1. Full Stack E-Commerce Website

First Project is from Sonny Sangha's Next.js 15 course
This one's cool because I'll learn how to use Sanity, Stripe and Clerk + building on Tailwind and TS knowledge

### 2. TBD
